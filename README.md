# Geochemistry Parsing
This notebook uses the GSQ Open Data Portal API to extract submitted collar files within a given area, and gives an example how to extract the corresponding locations. The purpose of this is not to be the definitive process in extracting geochemistry data, but outlining the problem and how one might approach building own tabular source.

With the introduction of the Geoscience Data Modernisation Project (GDMP), GSQ now receives all data in a standardised and consistent format. This resolves many of the historical data problems previously.
